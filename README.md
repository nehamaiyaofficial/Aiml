🎓 Assignments Repository

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where all the brainy bits from my **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** coursework live. 🧠💻

Since this is mostly academic work, contributions are limited for now—but feel free to open an issue or drop suggestions! Constructive feedback is always welcome. 🙌<br>
📌 Note
This reposi<br>tory is mainly for educational purposes. If you're referencing code for your own assignments, make sure you understand it and write it in your own style. Let's keep things ethical and honest! ✨<br>
Made with 💻, ☕, and a lot of deadline stress 😅 <br>
