They form when very massive stars die and collapse under their own gravity. At the center of a black hole is a singularity, a point of infinite density where our current physics laws break down."

They contain weakened or inactivated parts of a particular organism that triggers an immune response in the body. This helps the body develop immunity to that specific disease without having to get the illness first, creating memory cells that remember how to fight that disease in the future."

Since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which produces heat-trapping gases. This leads to rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, more extreme weather events, and rising sea levels."

It also helps reduce stress and anxiety while potentially extending your lifespan."

When you access a website, your device sends a request through your Internet Service Provider to servers that host the website. The data is broken into packets, transmitted over various network paths, and reassembled at your device to display the website content."

                    "answer": "Rainbows form when sunlight enters water droplets in the atmosphere, gets refracted (bent), reflects off the back of the droplet, and then refracts again as it exits. This process separates white sunlight into its component colors. You'll only see a rainbow if the sun is behind you and rain or mist is in front of you at the right angle."

                    "question": "Why is the sky blue?",
                    "answer": "The sky appears blue because air molecules scatter sunlight. Specifically, they scatter shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) more than longer wavelengths. While violet light is actually scattered more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, so the sky appears blue to us rather than violet."

This allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information and solve certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers. They have potential applications in cryptography, drug development, weather forecasting, and complex system optimization."

They have processors that run operating systems and applications, cellular radios for communication, GPS for location tracking, various sensors (accelerometer, proximity sensor, etc.), and touchscreens for user interaction. They function by converting your touch inputs into electrical signals that the processor interprets to perform actions."
